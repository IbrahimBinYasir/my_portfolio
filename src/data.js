When actuated, the biomimetic actuator was able to produce forces up to 11.5 N at 135 KPa, satisfying the required criteria of 8N for palm grasping. The proposed soft bio-inspired hybrid bending actuator was used as a supernumerary sixth finger for rehabilitation and robot grippers",

      "I met Ibrahim while we were both international students at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. We worked together on a project in a class called Intelligent Robotics where Ibrahim exhibited a great enthusiasm for making a highly interesting project that I am still very proud of today. He came up with the idea to train a reinforcement learning agent to control the shape of a memory alloy using an electrical current. Ibrahim was a central part of ensuring that the project succeeded: He took the lead on the mechanical and electrical parts of the project while simultaneously having a firm grib of the software and theoretical parts of the reinforcement learning algorithm. Besides from being a skilled professional, I also found Ibrahim to be a joy to work with since his personality made everyone in the team feel included and he contributed to a fun atmosphere.",

        "He and I did a project together in the lecture about soft robotics. He reached me first to do the project together and actively worked from start to finish. He was a creative thinker as well as a person who could look at each idea critically to reach the best idea, which I personally think is important for the engineer to develop something that really can help people. He was also a person who could patiently teach others what he is good at. As I was dealing with SMA (shape memory alloy) for the first time in the project, he calmly taught me how to deal with it and encouraged me to do it again even if I did something wrong. Not only did I learn a lot while working on the project with him, but also it was a fortune to get to know him as a fellow researcher and a good friend.",

      "I worked with Ibrahim during my Bachelor's degree for our final year project. We set an ambitious goal for ourselves, some may say over ambitious, but we spared no effort into trying to achieve it. Ibrahim was there every step of the way and people may find a number of faults with him but I don't think anyone can say he doesn't put in the time and effort. Lastly he is a fun person to work with which brightened up the mood when we found ourselves stuck and banging our heads against the wall.",
