    description:
      "Developed a bio-inspired hybrid actuator inspired by crustacean exoskeleton by incorporating rigid shells and a soft core. When actuated, the biomimetic actuator was able to produce forces up to 11.5 N at 135 KPa, satisfying the required criteria of 8N for palm grasping. The proposed soft bio-inspired hybrid bending actuator was used as a supernumerary sixth finger for rehabilitation and robot grippers",
