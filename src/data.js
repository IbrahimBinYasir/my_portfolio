    description:
      "Developed a bio-inspired hybrid actuator inspired by crustacean exoskeleton by incorporating rigid shells and a soft core. When actuated, the biomimetic actuator was able to produce forces up to 11.5 N at 135 KPa, satisfying the required criteria of 8N for palm grasping. The proposed soft bio-inspired hybrid bending actuator was used as a supernumerary sixth finger for rehabilitation and robot grippers",

      "I worked with Ibrahim during my Bachelor's degree for our final year project. We set an ambitious goal for ourselves, some may say over ambitious, but we spared no effort into trying to achieve it. Ibrahim was there every step of the way and people may find a number of faults with him but I don't think anyone can say he doesn't put in the time and effort. Lastly he is a fun person to work with which brightened up the mood when we found ourselves stuck and banging our heads against the wall",
